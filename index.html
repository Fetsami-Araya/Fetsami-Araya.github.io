            I've spent the past few years studying economics and data science and from the very beginning, I found both subjects fascinating.  
            In my undergraduate degree at the University of Calgary, I majored in Economics and gravitated towards econometrics (the use of statistics to answer economic questions). 
            The more I studied econometrics, the more I realized that if I wanted to continue doing this kind of work, I would need a solid understanding of programming so I could gather data and implement complex statistical models. 
            So, I added a minor in Data Science, learned Python, R, and SQL, and also decided to pursue a master's degree in Economics at the University of Toronto (which I am currently enrolled in). 
            
            As a TA at the University of Toronto, I'm helping students in a course meant to teach data science to economics majors, and as a student, 
            I'm enrolled in courses (e.g. econometrics, machine learning applications in economics) which will allow me to continue to practice programming and learn more about practical applications of data science.
            In my internships, I've been able to take advantage of my experience in data science and economics to provide real value. 
            
            During my most recent internship at the Canada Energy Regulator, I used Python to automate data cleaning tasks and to implement forecasting models for Canadian electricity exports. 
            Similarly, as an RA at the University of Calgary, I used Python and its various data science libraries along with High-Performance Computing resources to clean and process large amounts of patent data, a process that would have been impossible without these tools.
            
            After finishing my MA in April 2021, I have just started a position as a Recruit Analyst at Statistics Canada as part of their Analyst Rotational Program. Over the course of the next two years, I'll be working on classifying, computing, and improving the Canadian System of National Accounts.
